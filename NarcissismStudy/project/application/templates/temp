        <p class="lead">Our team is from Social AI, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. who study Human Behaviors and Social AI. We model and analyze the agent systems in the area of human ambiance,
          through which we study behaviors from scientific disciplines like Biology, Pschology and Social Sciences.
          Human behaviors can be influenced over time with different factors like harmonal changes, moods, feedbacks and so on.
          We investigate what are the possible factors which influence human behaviors, with the aim of minimizing the negative factors/behaviors.
